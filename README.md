# Redline
Redline, a PKZIP/DynaZIP/Custom unpacker/repacker/modifier built upon zlibnet for decompressing RPM packages.

### Usage:
Build and run. You have three tabs; Pack, Unpack, Remove.
<p>
You can use each of these by pointing them to an RPM/RPMX file and choosing the option you want to use.
<p>
Pack allows you to pack files into a file, Unpack allows you to unpack a file & Remove allows you to selectively remove files from the archive.
